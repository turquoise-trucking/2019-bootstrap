# Theme To-do

Once bugs are addressed we have a few things to-do regarding the Turquoise theme and website.

## Add custom 404 page

Taking the heretofore unused maintenance page as a base a custom 404 to use in the event of a bad link. The [WordPress Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_an_Error_404_Page) has a good example of one complete with the ability to send the admin an email each time a 404 page is produced. 

## Create template pages

This will take some time. Right now the WordPress pages contain raw HTML markup but I'd rather they used copy (text) instead. This could be accomplished by creating templates for how each page looks unique to their physical layout. Hopefully accomplished through a core method or even a free plugin.
