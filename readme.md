# Readme for 2019-bootstrap

A quick writeup for the reason behind this theme. More or less, I lack WordPress experience so when it came to building a new website I designed one by hand instead of using WordPress Themes. Now, in order for the static website to be hosted it must be converted into a theme.



## Why the name?

The website and subsequent theme was made at the tail-end of 2019 thus the year.  Bootstrap is a component library used to structurally build the website with help from other technology listed. 

[Bootstrap]: https://getbootstrap.com/
[Font Awesome]: https://fontawesome.com/
[jQuery]: https://jquery.com/



## How are you converting the theme?
